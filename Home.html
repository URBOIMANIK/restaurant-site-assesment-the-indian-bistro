		From the Owner,
			<article>
		The minute you step into The Indian Bistro, you feel as though you are in an inviting treasure trove of east meets west. Furniture, tableware and lighting are designed with a mix of the exotic and chic. The walls are covered with an eye-catching bold and funky mural in blues and purples, which turns out to have a very personal connection while food remembers you the flavours of India on your table.
